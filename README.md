## About Me
I am a Computer Science Lecturer and Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in building intelligent systems, AI-driven automation solutions, multi-agent workflows, and modern web applications.  

I have worked on multiple international hackathons and real-world projects, collaborating with global teams to deliver scalable, innovative, and impactful AI solutions. My teaching experience has allowed me to mentor hundreds of students, guiding them to develop practical programming skills and deep technical knowledge.  

I specialize in designing AI solutions, LLM integrations, full-stack web applications, and enterprise automation platforms. My goal is to create technology that not only solves complex problems but also improves efficiency, accessibility, and user experience across domains like education, agriculture, healthcare, and business workflows.
